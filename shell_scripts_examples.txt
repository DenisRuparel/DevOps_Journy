shell scripting basics:
----------------

1) echo "<enter your message to print>"
-> it prints the message what you want to print
-> we can also write this command like this echo "hello i am denis ruparel" > testfile.txt

2) nano <file_name>.sh
-> it creates shell file in your directory

demo script:
----------
#!/bin/bash
echo "hello world"

3) bash <file_name>.sh
-> it runs (executes) the shell script file

--------------------------
or another way to run shell file
--------------------------

*) ./<file_name>.sh
-> note: if permission is given by you[admin] to execute the file then this command will work otherwise first you[admin] should give the information to run the file

4) chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...]
-> chmod modifying the permissions for the owner, group, and others for a file or directory

shell scripts examples:

mkdir new_dir
cd new_dir
